# Steam Description

```
Adds 1 new technology option and 8 traits for species with the cybernetic trait. The traits are unlocked after researching "Bio-Synthetic Interfacing" which requires both the "Genome Mapping" and "Powered Exoskeletons" technologies to be researched as well as the completion of "The Flesh is Weak" special project.

There are two groups of traits: [b]Implants[/b] and [b]Frameworks[/b]. Each species can support one trait from each group - traits within a group are mutually exclusive
